This is also true of his second wife, who was present when we discussed some of what is presented here, about 2010. It may be that he chose to downplay his Ponsonby Irish family connections.

Takapuna Grammar in the 1970's was a benign but slightly chaotic environment under headmaster Jack Kelly. Many of the teachers were eccentric, in retrospect.

My dutiful parents felt that I should engage with the newly appointed careers guidance councillor, Mrs Geary, to plan ahead. Mrs Geary, in retrospect, must have been appointed because she was particularly eccentric and no longer suitable for classroom duties.  She asked me if I liked to be outside, and then said that farm work would be a good fit for me. I was an unprepossessing youth, and my poor self presentation no doubt contributed to her guidance, which I took without question."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Here, we run into some important issues that those doing history face.
